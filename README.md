This repository hosts the code to run www.balldontlie.io and its API.
The script to retrieve data is stored in a private repository elsewhere.

## Development
**API**
We're using rails to run the server:
`bundle install`
`rails s`

**Docs**
We're using [slate](https://github.com/lord/slate) to generate the docs page.
`cd frontend`
`bundle install`
`bundle exec middleman server`
